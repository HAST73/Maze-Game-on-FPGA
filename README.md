# ðŸ§© Maze Game â€“ FPGA Implementation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**Maze Game** is an FPGA-based interactive project implemented on a **Xilinx Spartan-3E** board.  
The player controls a **red square** using **W, S, A, D** keys on a **PS/2 keyboard** and must navigate through a static maze to reach the **green square** goal.  
The game is displayed on a **VGA monitor** with a resolution of **600Ã—440 pixels**, using distinct colors for different elements:

- ðŸŸ¥ **Red** â€“ Player  
- ðŸŸ© **Green** â€“ Goal  
- ðŸŸ¦ **Blue** â€“ Maze walls  
- âšª **White** â€“ Background  

The game includes:
- **Collision detection** to prevent passing through walls  
- **Step-by-step movement** with controlled delay  
- **Win detection** when reaching the goal

## ðŸŽ® Features
- Fully implemented in **VHDL**
- **VGA output** with pixel-level rendering
- **PS/2 keyboard** input handling
- **Static maze generation** with precise wall placement
- **Smooth gameplay** with controlled movement speed
- **Goal detection** and game end condition

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **Startup:** Player starts in the **top-left corner** of the maze  
2. **Controls:**  
   - **W** â€“ Move up  
   - **S** â€“ Move down  
   - **A** â€“ Move left  
   - **D** â€“ Move right  
3. **Rules:**  
   - Cannot pass through **blue walls**  
   - Movement speed is limited via a **delay counter**  
4. **Goal:** Reach the **green square** to win
